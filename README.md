# labs-bot

This is a bot for Penn Labs to use to alert them whenever they're mentioned on Slack, but it can be used general-purpose too. For an example config, see `config.yaml.example`.

To start the bot, make sure you've made a `config.yaml` file with your credentials, and run:

```bash
$ docker-compose up --build
```
